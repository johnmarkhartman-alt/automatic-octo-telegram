Personal\n\nMy name is John Hartman and I have been living in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, since 2025. I have lived and worked in Asia for over a decade, and attended university in Tokyo, Japan.\n* I have FSQA and Operations experience at multiple companies, both in Japan and the USA.  I have worked in the restaurant/franchise operations arena, in food production/R&D, and in industrial food production.\n* I have been performing data analysis for over twenty years, and as of February 2026 I have received the Google Data Analytics Certificate.\n* I am interested in helping food companies in SE Asia bring their operations to export standard or helping overseas companies create alliances with Vietnamese companies.\n\n### What Problems Do I Solve?\nI help food and operations leaders make better, faster decisions by turning messy compliance and operational data into clear risk priorities.\n\nSpecifically, I solve problems like:\n\n“We have too many audit findings. Where do we actually start?”\n→ I identify the small subset of suppliers, sites, or processes that drive the majority of food-safety risk.\n\n“Everything feels urgent, but we don’t have infinite resources.”\n→ I quantify risk concentration so teams can focus corrective action where it will have the biggest impact.\n\n“We track CAPAs, but we don’t know which ones matter most.”\n→ I analyze corrective-action load, closure time, and repeat findings to distinguish signal from noise.\n\n“Executives want answers, not spreadsheets.”\n→ I translate technical FSQA data into operational and executive-level insights that support prioritization and investment decisions.\n\n“Our data exists, but it isn’t decision-ready.”\n→ I clean, structure, and model real-world datasets so they reflect how food operations actually work — not textbook examples.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Project A - Risk Concentration Analysis\nThe question: \n**Is food-safety risk evenly distributed across suppliers, or concentrated among a small subset that should be prioritized?**\n\nThis project tests whether audit findings cluster disproportionately among certain suppliers, severities, or categories, rather than being spread evenly across the network.\nOperators don’t fail because they lack data. They fail because everything looks urgent.\nBy identifying where risk is actually concentrated, this analysis enables:\n* Targeted audits instead of blanket pressure\n* Focused supplier engagement\n* Smarter use of limited FSQA and operations resources\n\nIt shifts teams from reactive firefighting to intentional prioritization.\n\nThis study identified that roughly 15% of suppliers accounted for over 50% of total audit findings, with a disproportionate share of Major and Critical issues.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Project B - Corrective Action Load & CAPA Performance\nThe question: **Which suppliers and issue types create the greatest corrective-action burden, and where intervention will actually reduce future workload?**\n\nThis project evaluates not just how many findings occur, but:\n* How long they take to close;\n* Which ones repeat;\n* Which suppliers consistently consume the most follow-up effort.\n\n### How it complements Project A\n\nProject A identifies where risk originates.\nProject B shows where effort is being spent.\n\nTogether, they answer:\nAre we focusing our time on the same suppliers that drive our highest risk, or are we misallocating effort?\n\nThis pairing turns static risk ranking into dynamic operational control.\n\n### Why it's realistic and operationally grounded\n\nThis analysis mirrors how FSQA and ops teams actually experience the work:\n\n* CAPAs compete for attention\n* Closure time matters as much as severity\n* Repeat findings signal systemic failure, not one-off errors\n\nThe metrics used (repeat rate, days to closure, workload concentration) reflect real management pain points, not abstract KPIs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Taken together, these projects create a practical decision framework that helps organizations reduce food-safety risk while lowering corrective-action workload — using the same data they already collect.","metadata":{}}]}
